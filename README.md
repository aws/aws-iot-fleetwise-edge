# Reference Implementation for AWS IoT FleetWise

:information_source: To quickly get started, jump to the
[Edge Agent Developer Guide](./docs/dev-guide/edge-agent-dev-guide.md), the
[Android Guide](./tools/android-app/README.md), or the
[Raspberry Pi Tutorial](./docs/rpi-tutorial/raspberry-pi-tutorial.md).

AWS IoT FleetWise is a service that makes it easy for Automotive OEMs, Fleet operators, Independent
Software vendors (ISVs) to collect, store, organize, and monitor data from vehicles at scale. The
Reference Implementation for AWS IoT FleetWise ("FWE") provides C++ libraries that can be run with
simulated vehicle data on certain supported vehicle hardware or that can help you develop an Edge
Agent to run an application on your vehicle that integrates with AWS IoT FleetWise. You can then use
AWS IoT FleetWise's to process the collected data, gain insights about the vehicle's health and use
the service's visual interface to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential issues with your
vehicles. Furthermore, AWS IoT FleetWise's capability to collect ECU data and store them on cloud
databases enables you to utilize different AWS services (Analytics Services, ML, etc.) to develop
novel use-cases that augment your existing vehicle functionality. In particular, AWS IoT FleetWise
can leverage fleet data (Big Data) and enable you to develop use cases that create business value,
for example: improve electric vehicle range estimation, optimized battery life charging, optimized
vehicle routing, etc. AWS IoT FleetWise can be extended to utilize cloud computing capabilities for
use-cases such as helping to improve pet/child detection, Driver Monitoring System applications,
Predictive Diagnostics, electric vehicle's battery cells outlier detection, etc. You can use the
included sample C++ application to learn more about the FWE, develop an Edge Agent for your use case
and test interactions before integration.

> _**Important**_ As provided in the AWS IoT FleetWise

## AWS IoT FleetWise Architecture

AWS IoT FleetWise is an AWS service that enables automakers and fleet operators to collect, store,
organize, and monitor data from vehicles. Automakers need the ability to connect remotely to their
fleet of vehicles and collect vehicle ECU/sensor data. AWS IoT FleetWise can be used by OEM
engineers and data scientists to build vehicle models that can be used to build custom data
collection schemes. These data collection schemes enables the OEM to optimize the data collection
process by defining what signals to collect, how often to collect them, and most importantly the
trigger conditions ("events") that enable the collection process.

Customers can define the data collection schemes to trigger based on a schedule or on specific
conditions such as, but not limited to: 1. Ambient temperature dropping to below 0 degree or 2.
Vehicle crosses state lines or 3. Active diagnostic trouble codes. These conditions are sent to the
vehicle through a set of documents called data collection schemes. In summary, your Edge Agent
collects the data of interest according to the data collection schemes and decoding rules as
specified by the OEM on the [AWS IoT FleetWise Console](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/).

The following diagram illustrates a high-level architecture of the system.

**FWE receives two documents:**

1. _Decoder Manifest_ - this document describes how signals are collected from the vehicle, and will
   include details such as, but not limited to: Bus ID, network name, decoding information, etc.

2. _Data Collection Schemes_ - this document describes what signals to collect. It also describes
   the condition logic that defines the enablement of the trigger logic that allows these signals to
   be collected, for example, when Vehicle Speed > 100 km/Hr and Driver Seatbelt is Off and Ambient
   Temperature < 0 degree C.

## FWE Deployment & Supported Platforms

The functional flexibility of FWE and its use of dynamic memory allocation means that it cannot
reside in the real-time safety vehicle ECUs. FWE must also be connected to the internet and
preferably has access to a "good" portion of vehicle ECU data. OEMs have the flexibility to decide
where they can deploy their Edge Agent binary. Possible options include (if present):

1. Vehicle Gateway such as the
   [NXP S32G](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/s32g-vehicle-network-processors/s32g2-processors-for-vehicle-networking:S32G2)
   and
   [Renesas R-Car S4](https://www.renesas.com/jp/en/products/automotive-products/automotive-system-chips-socs/rtp8a779f0askb0sp2s-r-car-s4-reference-boardspider)
2. Vehicle Head-Unit
3. Vehicle's High Performance Computer
4. Telecommunication Control Unit

FWE was built and tested on 64-bit architectures. It has been tested on both ARM and X86 multicore
based machines, with a Linux Kernel version of 5.4 and above. The kernel module for ISO-TP
(`can-isotp`) would need to be installed in addition for Kernels below 5.10.

FWE was also tested on an EC2 Instance with the following details:

- **Platform**: Ubuntu
- **Platform Details**: Linux/UNIX
- **Server**: AmazonEC2
- **InstanceType**: c4.8xlarge
- **AvailabilityZone**: us-east-1
- **Architecture**: x86_64
- **CpuOptions**: {'CoreCount': 18, 'ThreadsPerCore': 2}
- **AMI name**: ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-20230112

## AWS IoT FleetWise Client-Server Communication

FWE depends on the [AWS SDK for C++](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp) to send and receive data
from and to AWS IoT FleetWise Server. All data sent to the AWS IoT FleetWise server is sent over an
encrypted
[TLS connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/data-encryption.html) using
MQTT, which is designed to make it secure by default while in transit. FWE uses MQTT quality of
service zero (QoS = 0).

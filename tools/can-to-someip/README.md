# CAN to SOME/IP

There are two versions of this tool provided: one written in Python `can-to-someip.py` using
[pysomeip](https://github.com/afflux/pysomeip) and one written in C++ using
[vsomeip](https://github.com/COVESA/vsomeip).

Using the C++ version may be desirable if the UNIX domain socket functionality of `vsomeip` is
required.

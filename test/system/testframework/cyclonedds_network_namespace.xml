        <!-- When not using lo as the network interface, the python process usually hangs waiting for
        some CycloneDDS threads to stop. There are some reports like https://github.com/ros2/rmw_cyclonedds/issues/104
        and https://github.com/ros2/rmw_cyclonedds/issues/85 with similar symptoms. There seems to be
        some changes merged, so maybe newer versions don't have this issue. Since we are using an EOL
        version of ROS2, for now disabling multiple threads avoid the issue. -->

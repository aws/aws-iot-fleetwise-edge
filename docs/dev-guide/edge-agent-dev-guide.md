# AWS IoT FleetWise quick start demo

This guide is intended to quickly demonstrate the basic features of AWS IoT FleetWise by firstly building AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent and running it on an AWS EC2 instance representing one or more simulated vehicles. A script is then run using the AWS CLI to control AWS IoT FleetWise Cloud in order collect data from the vehicle.

This guide showcases AWS IoT FleetWise at a high level. If you are interested in exploring AWS IoT FleetWise at a more detailed technical level, see [Getting started with AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent](#getting-started-with-aws-iot-fleetwise-edge-agent).

**Topics:**

- Prerequisites
- Build the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software
- Use the AWS IoT FleetWise cloud demo
- Explore collected data

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have already logged in to the AWS console in your desired region using an account with administrator rights.

- Note: AWS IoT FleetWise is currently available in US East (N. Virginia) and Europe (Frankfurt).

### Build the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software

An AWS CloudFormation template is used to build AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent using AWS CodeBuild and deploy it to a new AWS EC2 instance using AWS CodeDeploy.

1. Click here to [**Launch CloudFormation Template**](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Faws-iot-fleetwise.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Flatest%2Fcfn-templates%2Ffwdemo.yml&stackName=fwdemo).
1. (Optional) You can increase the number of simulated vehicles by updating the `FleetSize` parameter. You can also specify the region IoT Things are created in by updating the `IoTCoreRegion` parameter.
1. Select the checkbox next to _‘I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.’_
1. Choose **Create stack**.
1. Wait until the status of the Stack is ‘CREATE_COMPLETE’, this will take approximately 15 minutes.

AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software has been deployed to an AWS EC2 Graviton (ARM64) Instance along with credentials that allow it to connect to AWS IoT Core. CAN data is also being generated on the EC2 instance to simulate periodic hard-braking events. The AWS IoT FleetWise Cloud demo script in the following section will deploy a campaign to the simulated fleet of vehicles to capture the engine torque when a hard braking-event occurs.

### Use the AWS IoT FleetWise cloud demo

The instructions below will register your AWS account for AWS IoT FleetWise, create a demonstration vehicle model, register the virtual vehicle created in the previous section and run a campaign to collect data from it.

1. Open the AWS CloudShell: [Launch CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home)
1. Copy and paste the following commands to clone the latest AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software from GitHub, install the dependencies of the cloud demo script and enable IoT FleetWise commands in the AWS CLI.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge.git ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge \
       && cd ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge/tools/cloud \
       && pip3 install wrapt==1.10.0 plotly==5.3.1 pandas==1.3.4 cantools==36.4.0 \
       && aws configure add-model --service-model file://iotfleetwise-2021-06-17.json \
           --service-name iotfleetwise
   ```

   The AWS IoT FleetWise Cloud demo script performs the following:

   - Registers your AWS account with AWS IoT FleetWise, if not already registered
   - Creates a signal catalog, firstly based on `obd-nodes.json` to add standard OBD signals, and secondly based on the the DBC file `hscan.dbc` to add CAN signals in a flat signal list
   - Creates a model manifest that references the signal catalog with all of the OBD and DBC signals
   - Activates the model manifest
   - Creates a decoder manifest linked to the model manifest using `obd-decoders.json` for decoding OBD signals from the network interfaces defined in `network-interfaces.json`
   - Imports the CAN signal decoding information from `hscan.dbc` to the decoder manifest
   - Updates the decoder manifest to set the status as `ACTIVE`
   - Creates a vehicle with an ID equal to `fwdemo` which is the same as the name given to the CloudFormation Stack name in the previous section
   - Creates a fleet
   - Associates the vehicle with the fleet
   - Creates a campaign from `campaign-brake-event.json` that contains a condition-based collection scheme to capture the engine torque and the brake pressure when the brake pressure is above 7000, and targets the campaign at the fleet
   - Approves the campaign
   - Waits until the campaign status is `HEALTHY`, which means the campaign has been deployed to the fleet
   - Waits 30 seconds and then downloads the collected data from Timestream
   - Saves the data to an HTML file

1. Run the demo script:

   ```bash
   ./demo.sh --vehicle-name fwdemo
   ```

   1. (Optional) If you selected a `FleetSize` of greater than one above, append the option `--fleet-size <SIZE>`, where `<SIZE>` is the number selected.
   1. (Optional) If you changed `IoTCoreRegion` above, append the option `--region <REGION>`, where `<REGION>` is the selected region.
   1. (Optional) If you changed `Stack name` when creating the stack above, pass the
      new stack name to the `--vehicle-name` option.

   For example, if you chose to create two AWS IoT things in Europe (Frankfurt) with a stack named `myfwdemo`, you must pass those values when calling `demo.sh`:

   ```bash
   ./demo.sh --vehicle-name myfwdemo --fleet-size 2 --region eu-central-1
   ```

1. When the script completes, a path to an HTML file is given in the format `/home/cloudshell-user/aws-iot-fleetwise-cloud/fwdemo-<TIMESTAMP>.html`. Copy the path, then click on the Actions drop down menu in the top-right corner of the CloudShell window and choose **Download file**. Paste the path to the file, choose **Download**, and open the downloaded file in your browser.

### Explore collected data

1. To explore the collected data, you can click and drag to zoom in. The red line shows the simulated brake pressure signal. As you can see that when hard braking events occur (value above 7000), collection is triggered and the engine torque signal data is collected.
   1. Alternatively, if your AWS account is enrolled with Amazon QuickSight or Grafana, you may use them to browse the data from Amazon Timestream directly.

An Ubuntu 18.04 development machine with 200GB free disk space will be required. A local Intel x86_64 (amd64) machine can be used, however it is recommended to use the following instructions to launch an AWS EC2 Graviton (arm64) instance. Pricing for EC2 can be found, [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/).

1. Launch an EC2 Graviton instance with administrator permissions: [**Launch CloudFormation Template**](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Faws-iot-fleetwise.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Flatest%2Fcfn-templates%2Ffwdev.yml&stackName=fwdev).
1. Enter the **Name** of an existing SSH key pair in your account from [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#KeyPairs:).
   1. Do not include the file suffix `.pem`.
   1. If you do not have an SSH key pair, you will need to create one and download the corresponding `.pem` file. Be sure to update the file permissions: `chmod 400 <PATH_TO_PEM>`
1. **Select the checkbox** next to _‘I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.’_
1. Choose **Create stack**.
1. Wait until the status of the Stack is **CREATE_COMPLETE**; this can take up to five minutes.
1. Select the **Outputs** tab, copy the EC2 IP address, and connect via SSH from your local machine to the development machine.

   ```bash
   ssh -i <PATH_TO_PEM> ubuntu@<EC2_IP_ADDRESS>
   ```

### Compile AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software

1. Run the following _on the development machine_ to clone the latest AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software from GitHub.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge.git ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge \
       && cd ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge
   ```

   You can browse the `README.md` and source code while referring to this guide.

1. Install the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent dependencies

   1. `install-deps-native.sh` — installs the following Ubuntu packages:
      `libssl-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-log-dev libboost-thread-dev build-essential cmake unzip git wget curl zlib1g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsnappy-dev default-jre libasio-dev`. Additionally it installs the following: `jsoncpp protobuf aws-sdk-cpp`
   1. `install-socketcan.sh` — installs the following Ubuntu packages: `build-essential dkms can-utils git linux-modules-extra-aws`. Additionally it installs the following: `can-isotp`. It also installs a systemd service called `setup-socketcan` that brings up the virtual SocketCAN interface `vcan0` at startup.
   1. `install-cansim.sh` — installs the following Ubuntu packages: `python3.7 python3-setuptools curl`. It then installs Python PIP for Python 3.7 and the following PIP packages: `wrapt cantools prompt_toolkit python-can can-isotp matplotlib`. It also installs a systemd service called `cansim` that periodically transmits data on the virtual SocketCAN bus `vcan0` to simulate vehicle data.

   ```bash
   sudo -H ./tools/install-deps-native.sh \
       && sudo -H ./tools/install-socketcan.sh \
       && sudo -H ./tools/install-cansim.sh
   ```

1. Run the following to compile AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software:

   ```bash
   ./tools/build-fwe-native.sh
   ```

### Deploy AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software

1. Run the following _on the development machine_ to provision an AWS IoT Thing with credentials and install AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent as a service.

   **Note** To create AWS IoT things in Europe (Frankfurt), configure `--region` to `eu-central-1` in the call to `provision.sh`

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise \
       && sudo ./tools/provision.sh \
           --vehicle-name fwdemo-ec2 \
           --certificate-pem-outfile /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise/certificate.pem \
           --private-key-outfile /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise/private-key.key \
           --endpoint-url-outfile /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise/endpoint.txt \
           --vehicle-name-outfile /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise/vehicle-name.txt \
       && sudo ./tools/configure-fwe.sh \
           --input-config-file configuration/static-config.json \
           --output-config-file /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise/config-0.json \
           --vehicle-name `cat /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise/vehicle-name.txt` \
           --endpoint-url `cat /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise/endpoint.txt` \
           --can-bus0 vcan0 \
       && sudo ./tools/install-fwe.sh
   ```

   1. At this point AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent is running and periodically sending ‘checkins’ to AWS IoT FleetWise, in order to announce its current list of campaigns (which at this stage will be an empty list). CAN data is also being generated on the development machine to simulate periodic hard-braking events. The AWS IoT FleetWise Cloud demo script in the following section will deploy a campaign to the simulated vehicle to capture the engine torque when a hard braking-event occurs.

1. Run the following to view and follow the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent log. You can open a new SSH session with the development machine and run this command to follow the log in real time as the campaign is deployed in the next section. To exit the logs, use CTRL + C.

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -fu fwe@0
   ```

### Run the AWS IoT FleetWise demo script

The instructions below will register your AWS account for AWS IoT FleetWise, create a demonstration vehicle model, register the virtual vehicle created in the previous section, and run a campaign to collect data from it.

1. Run the following _on the development machine_ to install the dependencies of the AWS IoT FleetWise Cloud demo script and add AWS IoT FleetWise commands to the AWS CLI:

   1. `install-deps.sh` — installs the following Ubuntu packages: `python3.7 python3-setuptools curl`. It then installs Python PIP for Python 3.7 and the following PIP packages: `wrapt plotly pandas cantools`

   ```bash
   cd ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge/tools/cloud \
       && sudo -H ./install-deps.sh \
       && aws configure add-model \
           --service-model file://iotfleetwise-2021-06-17.json \
           --service-name iotfleetwise
   ```

1. Run the following to explore the AWS IoT FleetWise CLI:

   ```bash
   aws iotfleetwise help
   ```

1. Run the demo script:

   ```bash
   ./demo.sh --vehicle-name fwdemo-ec2
   ```

   1. (Optional) If you changed the `--region` option to `provision.sh` above, append the option `--region <REGION>`, where `<REGION>` is the selected region.
      For example, if you chose to create the AWS IoT thing in Europe (Frankfurt), you must configure `--region` to `eu-central-1` in the demo.sh file.

      ```bash
      ./demo.sh --vehicle-name fwdemo-ec2 --region eu-central-1
      ```

   1. The demo script:
      1. Registers your AWS account with AWS IoT FleetWise, if not already registered
      1. Creates a signal catalog, firstly based on `obd-nodes.json` to add standard OBD signals, and secondly based on the the DBC file `hscan.dbc` to add CAN signals in a flat signal list
      1. Creates a vehicle model (model manifest) that references the signal catalog with all of the OBD and DBC signals
      1. Activates the vehicle model
      1. Creates a decoder manifest linked to the vehicle model using `obd-decoders.json` for decoding OBD signals from the network interfaces defined in `network-interfaces.json`
      1. Imports the CAN signal decoding information from `hscan.dbc` to the decoder manifest
      1. Updates the decoder manifest to set the status as `ACTIVE`
      1. Creates a vehicle with an ID equal to `fwdemo-ec2` which is the same as the name passed to `provision.sh` above
      1. Creates a fleet
      1. Associates the vehicle with the fleet
      1. Creates a campaign from `campaign-brake-event.json` that contains a condition-based collection scheme to capture the engine torque and the brake pressure when the brake pressure is above 7000, and targets the campaign at the fleet
      1. Approves the campaign
      1. Waits until the campaign status is `HEALTHY`, which means the campaign has been deployed to the fleet
      1. Waits 30 seconds and then downloads the collected data from Amazon Timestream
      1. Saves the data to an HTML file

1. When the script completes, the path to the output HTML file is given. _On your local machine_, use `scp` to download it, then open it in your web browser:

   ```bash
   scp -i <PATH_TO_PEM> ubuntu@<EC2_IP_ADDRESS>:<PATH_TO_HTML_FILE> .
   ```

   To explore the collected data, you can click and drag on the graph to zoom in. The red line shows the simulated brake pressure signal. As you can see that when hard braking events occur (value above 7000), collection is triggered and the engine torque signal data is collected.

   Alternatively, if your AWS account is enrolled with QuickSight or Grafana, you may use them to browse the data from Amazon Timestream directly.

   ![](./images/collected_data_plot.png)

1. Run the following _on the development machine_ to deploy a ‘heartbeat’ campaign that collects OBD data from the vehicle. Repeat the process above to view the collected data.

   ```bash
   ./demo.sh --vehicle-name fwdemo-ec2 --campaign-file campaign-obd-heartbeat.json
   ```

   Similarly, if you chose to deploy the ‘heartbeat’ campaign that collects OBD data from an AWS IoT thing created in in Europe (Frankfurt), you must configure `--region`:

   ```bash
   ./demo.sh --vehicle-name fwdemo-ec2 --campaign-file campaign-obd-heartbeat.json --region eu-central-1
   ```

## Getting started with AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent on NXP S32G

This section describes how to deploy AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent onto an NXP S32G-VNP-RDB2 board.

### Prerequisites

- **NXP Semiconductors S32G Reference Design 2** — Part number: S32G-VNP-RDB2
- **AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent Compiled for ARM64** — If you are using an EC2 Graviton instance as your development machine, you will have completed this already above.

  - _If you are using a local Intel x86_64 (amd64) development machine_, you will need to run the following to cross-compile AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent:

    ```bash
    cd ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge \
        && sudo -H ./tools/install-deps-cross.sh \
        && rm -rf build \
        && ./tools/build-fwe-cross.sh
    ```

- **Internet Router with Ethernet** — The S32G-VNP-RDB2 must be connected to an internet router via an Ethernet cable for internet connectivity. It is beyond the scope of this document to describe how this is achieved, but one possibility is to use a WiFi to Ethernet bridge and a smartphone acting as an internet hotspot.

### Build an SD-Card Image

The following instructions use the development machine to build an SD-card image based on the Ubuntu variant of the NXP Linux BSP version 28.0, with the addition of the `can-isotp` kernel module required by AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent, an updated version of the `canutils` package and a `systemd` service called `setup-socketcan` for bringing up the CAN interfaces at startup.

1. Run the following _on the development machine_ to install the dependencies of the `bitbake` tool of the Yocto / OpenEmbedded project.

   ```bash
   cd ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge \
       && sudo ./tools/install-deps-yocto.sh
   ```

1. Run the following to create a build folder and setup the Yocto project:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/yocto-build && cd ~/yocto-build \
       && ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge/tools/setup-yocto-s32g.sh
   ```

1. Run the following to run `bitbake` to create the SD-card image and compress it. This can take several hours to complete depending on the performance of the development machine and the speed of the internet connection.

   ```bash
   source sources/poky/oe-init-build-env build_s32g274ardb2ubuntu \
       && bitbake fsl-image-ubuntu \
       && gzip -fk tmp/deploy/images/s32g274ardb2/fsl-image-ubuntu-s32g274ardb2.sdcard
   ```

1. Run the following _on your local machine_ to download the compressed SD-card image:

   ```bash
   scp -i <PATH_TO_PEM> ubuntu@<EC2_IP_ADDRESS>:yocto-build/build_s32g274ardb2ubuntu/tmp/deploy/images/s32g274ardb2/fsl-image-ubuntu-s32g274ardb2.sdcard.gz .
   ```

### Flash the SD-Card Image

1. Download and install Balena Etcher _on your local machine_: https://www.balena.io/etcher/
1. Run Balena Etcher, choose ‘Select image’ and select the compressed SD-card image
   `fsl-image-ubuntu-s32g274ardb2.sdcard.gz`
1. Insert the SD-card supplied with the S32G-VNP-RDB2 into your local machine’s SD-card reader
1. Choose ‘Select target’ and select the SD-card
1. Choose ‘Flash!’

### Specify Initial Board Configuration

1. Insert the SD-card into the S32G-VNP-RDB2’s SD-card slot.
1. Connect the S32G-VNP-RDB2’s power supply.
1. Connect an Ethernet cable from port P3A of the S32G-VNP-RDB2 to the internet router.

   ![](./images/s32g_golden_box.png)

1. Connect your local machine to the internet router, for example via WiFi or via Ethernet.
1. Connect to the S32G-VNP-RDB2 via SSH, entering password `bluebox`:
   `ssh bluebox@ubuntu-s32g274ardb2`
   1. If you can’t connect using the hostname `ubuntu-s32g274ardb2`, you will need to connect to the administration webpage of the internet router to obtain the IP address assigned to the S32G-VNP-RDB2. Use this IP address in place of `ubuntu-s32g274ardb2` used throughout this guide.
1. Once connected via SSH, check the board’s internet connection by running: `ping amazon.com`. There should be 0% packet loss.

### Provision AWS IoT Credentials

Run the following commands _on the development machine_ (after compiling AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent for ARM64 as explained above), to create an IoT Thing and provision credentials for it. The AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent binary and its configuration files will be packaged into a ZIP file ready to be deployed to the board.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy && cd ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy \
&& cp -r ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge/tools . \
&& mkdir -p build/src/executionmanagement \
&& cp ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge/build/src/executionmanagement/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge \
  build/src/executionmanagement/ \
&& mkdir -p config && cd config \
&& ../tools/provision.sh \
  --vehicle-name fwdemo-s32g \
  --certificate-pem-outfile certificate.pem \
  --private-key-outfile private-key.key \
  --endpoint-url-outfile endpoint.txt \
  --vehicle-name-outfile vehicle-name.txt \
&& ../tools/configure-fwe.sh \
  --input-config-file ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge/configuration/static-config.json \
  --output-config-file config-0.json \
  --vehicle-name `cat vehicle-name.txt` \
  --endpoint-url `cat endpoint.txt` \
  --can-bus0 can0 \
&& cd .. && zip -r aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy.zip .
```

### Deploy AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent on NXP S32G

1. Run the following _on your local machine_ to copy the deployment ZIP file from the EC2 machine to your local machine:

   ```bash
   scp -i <PATH_TO_PEM> ubuntu@<EC2_IP_ADDRESS>:aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy/aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy.zip .
   ```

1. Run the following _on your local machine_ to copy the deployment ZIP file from your local machine to the S32G (replacing `ubuntu-s32g274ardb2` with the IP address of the S32G if using the hostname is not supported):

   ```bash
   scp aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy.zip bluebox@ubuntu-s32g274ardb2:
   ```

1. SSH to the S32G board, as described above, then run the following **_on the S32G_** to install AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent as a service:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy && cd ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy \
       && unzip -o ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-deploy.zip \
       && sudo mkdir -p /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise \
       && sudo cp config/* /etc/aws-iot-fleetwise \
       && sudo ./tools/install-fwe.sh
   ```

1. Run the following **_on the S32G_** to view and follow the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent log (press CTRL+C to exit):

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -fu fwe@0
   ```

### Collect OBD Data

1. Run the following _on the development machine_ to deploy a ‘heartbeat’ campaign that periodically collects OBD data:

   ```bash
   cd ~/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge/tools/cloud \
       && ./demo.sh --vehicle-name fwdemo-s32g --campaign-file campaign-obd-heartbeat.json
   ```

**Note:**
If you unable to collect OBD data from a real vehicle, it is possible that the vehicle uses extended CAN identifiers for diagnostic communication. In this case, SSH to the S32G board and edit the file `/etc/aws-iot-fleetwise/config-0.json`, changing the key `useExtendedIds` to `true.` Restart AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent by running
`sudo systemctl restart fwe@0` and try running the demo script again.

# AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent Architecture

AWS IoT FleetWise is an AWS service that enables automakers to collect, store, organize, and monitor data from vehicles. Automakers need the ability to connect remotely to their fleet of vehicles and collect vehicle ECU and sensor data. The following diagram illustrates a high-level architecture of the system. AWS IoT FleetWise can be used by OEM engineers and data scientists to build vehicle models that can be used to create custom data collection schemes. These data collection schemes enable OEMs to optimize the data collection process by defining what signals to collect, how often to collect them, and most importantly the trigger conditions, or events, that enable the collection process.

This document reviews the architecture, operation, and key features of the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software.

## Terminology

**Decoder Manifest:** A configuration used for decoding raw vehicle data into physical measurements. For example, CAN DBC decodes raw data from CAN Bus frames into physical signals like EngineRPM, EngineSpeed, and RadarAmplitude.

**Data Collection Scheme:** A document that defines the rules used to collect data from a vehicle. It defines an event trigger, filters, duration and frequency of data collection. This document is used by AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent for collecting and filtering only relevant data. A data collection scheme can use multiple event triggers. It can be attached to a single vehicle or a fleet of vehicles.

**Board Support Package (BSP):** A set of libraries that support running AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent on a POSIX Operating System.

**Controller Area Network (CAN):** A serial networking technology that enables vehicle electronic devices to interconnect.

**On Board Diagnostics (OBD):** A protocol used to retrieve vehicle diagnostics information.

**Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)**

**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**

**Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)**

## Audience

This document is intended for System and Software Engineers at OEMs and System Integrators who are developing or integrating in-vehicle software. Knowledge of C/C++, POSIX APIs, in-vehicle Networking protocols (such as CAN) and external connectivity protocols (such as MQTT) are pre-requisites.

## Architecture Overview

The below figure outlines AWS IoT FleetWise system elements:

### User Flow

You can use the AWS IoT FleetWise Console to define a vehicle model, which consists of creating a semantic digital twin of the vehicle. The semantic twin includes the vehicle attributes such as model year, engine type, and the signal catalog of the vehicle. This vehicle description serves as a foundation to define data collection schemes and specify what data to collect and which collection triggers to inspect data.

AWS IoT FleetWise enables you to create campaigns that can be deployed to a fleet of vehicles. Once a campaign is active, it is deployed from the cloud to the target vehicles via a push mechanism. AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software uses the underlying collection schemes to acquire sensor data from the vehicle network. It applies the inspection rules and uploads the data back to AWS IoT FleetWise data plane. The data plane persists collected data in the OEM’s AWS Account; the account can then be used to analyse the data.

### Software Layers

AWS IoT FleetWise architecture allocates its functionalities into a set of software layers that are interdependent. The software layers exchange over abstract APIs that implement a dependency inversion design pattern. The below section describes each of the layers bottom up as outline in the figure above.

**Vehicle Data Acquisition**

This layer binds the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software with the vehicle network, leveraging the onboard device drivers and middle-wares the OEM uses in the target hardware. This layer listens and/or requests data from the vehicle network and forwards it to the Normalization layer for further decoding. It has a dependency on the host environment including the operating system, the peripheral drivers and the vehicle architecture overall. It communicates with the Vehicle Data Normalization layer via a message queue that implements a circular buffer, a FIFO, with a fixed size. Each network interface e.g. a CAN Bus Interface gets allocated a message queue and can be activated/deactivated separately.

**Vehicle Data Normalization**

This layer operates on the raw data received from the vehicle data acquisition layer, by applying various signal decoding rules that are vehicle protocol specific e.g. CAN Signal database files. The output of this layer is a set of transformed key/value pairs of signals and their corresponding values. This layer has a dependency on the decoding rules the OEM has defined for the signals they want to inspect, which are specified in the Cloud Control plane. This layer consumes the message queues provided by the data acquisition layer, and stores the decoded values into a signal history buffer. This signal history buffer has a maximum fixed size to not exhaust the system resources.

**Vehicle Data Inspection**

This layer of the software operates on the signal history buffer by applying the inspection rules. An inspection rule ties one or more signal value to a set of conditions. If the condition is met, a snapshot of the data at hand is shared with the Cloud data plane. More than one inspection rule can be defined and applied to the signal data. This layer holds a set of data structures that allow fast indexing of the data by identifier and time, so that the data collection can be achieved as a quick as the conditions are met. Once a snapshot of the signal data is available, this layer passes over the data to the Off-board connectivity layer for further processing. The mechanism of data transmission between these two layers uses also a message queue with a predefined maximum size.

**Scheme Management**

The Cloud control plane serves the device software with data collection scheme and decoder manifests. A decoder manifest is an artifact that defines the vehicle signal catalog and the way each signal can get decoded from its raw format. A collection scheme describes the inspection rules to be applied to the signal values. The Scheme Management module has the responsibility of managing the life cycle e.g. activation/deactivation based on time and version of the collection schemes and the decoder manifest delivered to the device software. The outcome of the scheme management are at any given point in time, the inspection matrix needed by the Data Inspection Layer and the decoding dictionary needed by by the Data Normalization layer.

**Off-board Connectivity**

This layer of the software owns the communication of the AWS IoT FleetWise vehicle software with the outside world i.e. AWS Cloud. It implements a publish/subscribe pattern, with two communication channels, one used for receiving collection schemes and decoder manifest from the Control Plane, and one for publishing the collected data back to the Data Plane.

This layer ensures that the Device Software has valid credentials to communicate securely with the Cloud APIs.

**Service Control**

This layer owns the execution context of the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software within the target hardware in the vehicle. It manages the lifecycle of the vehicle software, including the startup/shutdown sequences, along with acting as a local monitoring module to ensure smooth execution of the service. The configuration of the service is validated and loaded into the system in this layer of the software.

### Overview of the software libraries

The code base of the device software consists of 6 C++ libraries that implement the functionalities of the layers described above. All these libraries are loaded in a POSIX user space application running a single process.

![software libraries](./images/software_libraries.png)

These libraries are:

**BSP Library**

This library includes a set of APIs and utility functions that the rest of the system use to :

- Create and manage platform threads via a Thread and Signal APIs.
- Create and manage timers and clocks via a Timer and Clock APIs.
- Create loggers and metrics via Trace and logger APIs
- Monitor the CPU, IO and RAM usage of a module via CPU/IO/RAM utility functions.
- Persist data into a storage location via a Persistency API. This is used to persist and reload collection schemes and decoder manifest during shutdown and startup of the service.

This library is used uniformly by all the other libraries in the service.

**Vehicle Network Management Library**

This library implements a set of wrappers around the in vehicle network communication protocols, and realizes the function of vehicle data acquisition. In this version of the software, this library includes :

- An implementation of the Linux CAN APIs, to acquire standard CAN Traffic from the network using raw sockets.
- An implementation of the Linux ISO/TP over CAN APIs to acquire CAN Frames that are bigger than 8 Bytes e.g. Diagnostic frames.

Each of the CAN Interfaces configured in the system will have a dedicated socket open. For the Diagnostic session i.e. to request OBD II PIDs, a separate socket is open for writing and reading CAN Frames.
This library abstracts away all the Socket and Linux networking details from the rest of the system, and exposes only a circular buffer for each network interface configured, exposing the raw CAN Frames to be consumed by the Data Inspection Library.

**Data Management Library**

This library implements all raw data decoders. It offers a Raw CAN Data Decoder (Standard CAN), an OBD II (according to J1979 specification) decoder. Additionally, it implements the decoders for the Collection Schemes and Decoder manifests.

This library is used by the Data Inspection Library to normalize and decode the raw CAN Frames, and by the Execution Management library to initiate the Collection Scheme and decoder Manifest decoding.

The library also implements a serialization module to serialize the data the device software wants to send to the data plane. The serialization schema is described below in the data model.

**Data Inspection Library**

This library implements a software module for each of the following:

- Consume, decode and normalize of the CAN Raw Frames according to the Decoder Manifest available in the system.
- Consumer, decode and normalize of the ISO/TP CAN Frames (Diagnostic data) according to the Decoder Manifest available in the system.
- Filter and inspect the signals values decoded from the network according to the inspection rules provided in the Inspection Matrix.
- Cache of the needed signals in a signal history buffer.

Upon fulfillment of one or more trigger conditions, this library extracts from the signal history buffer a data snapshot that’s shared with the Off-board connectivity library for further processing. Again here a circular buffer is used as a transport mechanism of the data between the two libraries.

**Connectivity Library**

This library implements the communication routines between the device software and the Cloud Control and Data Plane.

Since all the communication between the device and the cloud occurs over a secure MQTT connection, this library uses the AWS IoT Device SDK for C++ v2 as an MQTT client. It creates exactly one connection to the MQTT broker.

This library then publishes the data snapshot through that connection (through a dedicated MQTT topic) and subscribes to the Scheme and decoder manifest topic (dedicated MQTT topic) for eventual updates. On the subscribe side, this library notifies the rest of the system on the arrival of an update of either the Scheme or the decoder manifests, which are enacted accordant in near real time.

**Execution Management Library**

This library implements the bootstrap sequence of the device software. It parses the provided configuration and ensures that are the above libraries are provided with their corresponding settings. During shutdown, it ensures that all the modules and corresponding system resources (threads, loggers, and sockets) are stopped/closed properly.

If there is no connectivity, or during shutdown of the service , this library persists the data snapshots that are queued for sending to the cloud. Upon re-connection, this library will attempt to send the data to the cloud. The persistency module in the BSP library ensures that the disk space is not exhausted, so this library just invokes the persistency module when it wants to read or write data to disk.

The SystemD service communicates directly with this library as it runs the main thread of the application.

## Programming and Execution model

The device software implements a concurrent and event-based multithreading system.

- **In the Vehicle Network Management library,** each CAN Network Interface spawns one thread to take care of opening a Socket to the network device. E.g. if the device has 4 CAN Networks configured, there will be one thread per network mainly doing message reception from the network and insertion into the corresponding circular buffer in a lock free fashion. Each of the threads raises a notification via a listener interface in case the underlying socket communication is interrupted. These threads operate in a polling mode i.e. wait on socket read in non blocking mode.
- **In the Data Management Library**, one thread is created that manages the life cycle of the collection Scheme and decode manifest. This thread is busy waiting and wakes up only during an arrival of new collection schemes/manifest from the cloud, or during the expiry of any of the collection schemes in the system.
- **In the Data Inspection Library**, each of the following modules spawn threads:
  - The inspection rule engine that does active inspection of the signals having one thread.
  - One thread for each CAN Network consuming the data and decoding/normalizing, working in polling mode, and using a lock free container to read and write CAN Messages. [A boost spsc](https://theboostcpplibraries.com/boost.lockfree) queue is used for this purpose.
  - One thread taking care of controlling the health of the Network Interfaces (event based) and shutting down the sockets if a CAN IF is interrupted.
  - One thread that does run a Diagnostic session at a given time frequency (running J1979 PID and DTC request)
- **In the Connectivity Library**, most of the execution runs in the context of the main application thread. Callbacks and notifications from the MQTT stack happen in the context of the AWS IoT Device SDK thread. This module intercepts the notifications and switches the thread context to one of the device software threads so that no real data processing happens in the MQTT connection thread.
- **In the Execution Management Library**, there are two threads
  - One thread which is managing all the bootstrap sequence and intercepting SystemD signals i.e. application main thread
  - One orchestration thread: This thread acts as a shadow for the MQTT thread i.e. swallows connectivity errors and invokes the persistency module. On each run cycle it retries to send the data in the persistency location.

## Data Models

The device software defines four schemas that describe the communication with the Cloud Control and Data Plane services.

All the payloads exchanged between the device software and the cloud services are serialized in a Protobuff format.

### Device to Cloud communication

The device software sends two artifacts with the Cloud services:

**Check-in Information**

This check-in information consists of data collection schemes and decoder manifest Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that are active in the device software at a given time point. This check-in message is send regularly at a configurable frequency to the cloud services.

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
message Checkin {
    /*
    * List of document ARNs the Edge Agent software currently
    * has enacted including collection schemes (both idle and active)
    * and decoder manifest.
    */
    repeated string document_arns = 1;
    /*
     * Timestamp of when check in was generated in milliseconds since
     * the Unix epoch
     */
    uint64 timestamp_ms_epoch = 2;
}
```

**Data Snapshot Information**

This message is send conditionally to the cloud data plane services once one or more inspection rule is met. Depending on the configuration of the software, (e.g. send decoded and raw data), the device software sends one or more instance of this message in an MQTT packet to the cloud:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
message VehicleData {

    /*

        double double_value = 3;
    }
}

    */
   bytes byte_values = 4;
}

message DtcData {

    */
   sint64 relative_time_ms = 1;

    */
   repeated string active_dtc_codes = 2;
}

     */
    string geohash_string = 1;
}
```

### Cloud to Device communication

The Cloud Control plane services publish to the Device Software dedicated MQTT Topic the following two artifacts:

**Decoder Manifest** — This artifact describes the Vehicle Network Interfaces that the user defined. The description includes the semantics of each of the Network interface traffic to be inspected including the signal decoding rules:

## Data Persistency

The device software requires a temporary disk location in order to persist and reload the documents it exchanges with the cloud services. The persistency operates on three types of documents:

- Collection Schemes data: This data set is persisted during shutdown of the device software, and re-loaded upon startup.
- Decoder Manifest Data: This data set is persisted during shutdown of the device software, and re-loaded upon startup.
- Data Snapshots: This data set is persisted when there is no connectivity in the system. Upon the next startup of the service, the data is reloaded and send if there is connectivity.

The persistency module operates on a fixed/configurable maximum partition size. If there is no space left, the module does not persist the data.

All data exchanged between the device software and the cloud or persisted on the disk is compressed.

## Logging

The device software defines a Logger interface and implements a standard output logging backend. The interface can be extended to support other logging backends if needed.

The logger interface defines the following severity levels :

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Severity levels
 */
enum class LogLevel
{
    Trace,
    Info,
    Warning,
    Error,
    Off
};
```

Customers can set the System level logging severity externally via the software configuration file described below in the configuration section. Each log entry includes the following attributes:

```
[Thread: ID] [Time] [Level] [function]: [Message]
```

- Thread — the thread ID triggering the log entry.
- Time — the timestamp in milliseconds since Epoch.
- Level — the severity of the log entry.
- Function — the function name that invoked the log entry.
- Message — the actual log message.

## Security

The device software has been designed with security principles in mind. Security has been incorporated into four main domains:

- Device Authentication: the device software uses Client Certificates (x.509) to communicate with AWS IoT services. All the communications from and to the device software are over a secure TLS Connection. Refer to the [AWS IoT Security documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-client-certs.html) for further details.
- Data in transit: All the data exchanged with the AWS IoT services is encrypted in transit.
- Data at rest: the current version of the software does not encrypt the data at rest i.e. during persistency. It’s assumed that the software operates in a secure partition that the OEM puts in place and rely on the OEM secure storage infrastructure that is applied for all IO operations happening in the gateway e.g. via HSM, OEM crypto stack.
- Access to vehicle CAN data: the device software assumes that the software operates in a secure execution partition, that guarantees that if needed, the CAN traffic is encrypted/decrypted by the OEM Crypto stack (either on chip/HSM or via separate core running the crypto stack).

The device software can be extended to invoke cryptography APIs to encrypt and decrypt the data as per the need. 

The device software has been designed to be deployed in a non safety relevant in-vehicle domain/partition. Due to its use of dynamic memory allocation, this software is not suited for deployment on real time/lock step/safety cores.

### Best Practices and recommendation

You can use the cmake build option, `FWE_SECURITY_COMPILE_FLAGS`, to enable security-related compile options when building the binary. Consult the compiler manual for the effect of each option in `./cmake/compiler_gcc.cmake`. This flag is already enabled in the default [native compilation script](./tools/build-fwe-native.sh) and [cross compilation script](./tools/build-fwe-cross.sh)

Customers are encouraged to store key materials on hardware modules, such as hardware security module (HSM), Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), or other cryptographic elements. 
A HSM is a removable or external device that can generate, store, and manage RSA keys used in asymmetric encryption. A TPM is a cryptographic processor present on most commercial PCs and servers.

Please refer to [AWS IoT Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/security-best-practices.html) for recommended security best practices.

Please refer to [Device Manufacturing and Provisioning with X.509 Certificates in AWS IoT Core](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/device-manufacturing-provisioning.pdf) for security recommendations on device manufacturing and provisioning.

Note: This is **only** a recommendation. Your system must be protected with proper security measures.

## Supported Platforms

The AWS IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software has been developed for 64 bit architecture. It has been tested on both ARM and X86 multicore based machines, with a Linux Kernel version of 5.4 and above. The kernel module for ISO-TP (can-isotp) would need to be installed in addition for Kernels below 5.10.

## Disclaimer

The device software code base includes modules that are still in development an are disabled by default. These modules are not intended for use in a production environment. This includes the Data Distribution Service Support (DDS) that is used to communicate with any sensor node connected over a DDS bus, a Remote Profiler module that helps sending traces from the device to AWS Cloud Watch, and a JSON data serialization module that’s intended for dumping the collected data in a JSON format locally (mainly for local debugging needs).
The device software has been checked for any memory leaks and runtime errors such as type overflows using Valgrind. No issues have been detected during the load tests.
